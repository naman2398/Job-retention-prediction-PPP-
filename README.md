## Job Retention Prediction

### Problem Statement
Predict how many jobs a company will retain based on the publicly available loan data.

### Project Motivation
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was passed by Congress to provide relief to businesses negatively impacted by Covid-19, aiming to maintain employee pay. This program offered forgivable loans to businesses that continued to pay employees during the pandemic. However, the PPP quickly ran out of funds, leading to limitations in relief distribution. Controversy also arose from large, publicly traded companies receiving PPP funds while many small businesses struggled to access relief. This project seeks to address this issue by predicting job retention using publicly available loan data.

### Dataset

The [SBA PPP loan data](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-data), sourced from the U.S. Small Business Administration, provides critical information for predicting jobs retained in businesses that received PPP funds during the Covid-19 pandemic.

### Project Details
- **Data Preprocessing:** The project involves data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Target encoding is applied to engineer relevant features.
- **Data Scaling:** Data scaling techniques are used for feature normalization.
- **Model Building:** A simple neural network is constructed for regression to predict job retention.

This project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing job retention for businesses that received PPP funds, helping to ensure fair and effective distribution of relief.
